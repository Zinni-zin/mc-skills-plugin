Minecraft Skill Plugin
This is a plugin that adds 7 skills(Health, Mana, Mana Regen, Damage, Defense, Dodge Chance and Crit Chance) 
and a fancy menu to increase those skills!

There is also a tier system that can either increase based on the player's level or commands

Note: There is scoreboard code handled with packets and reflection, this code is only gets called if there's another outside plugin
to call the code, this allows for the scoreboard to be customized by any developer
